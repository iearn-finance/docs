# How Yearn increases your yield 

Almost everything that yVaults interact with is available to the public. So how is Yearn able to offer users better yield than they'd be able to achieve on their own? 

## Curve Finance Synergy 

Many of Yearn's strategies utilize Curve Finance's liquidity mining program. Curve Finance has a 300 year token distribution program for those who provide liquidity on the platform. Curve is an automated market maker that allows

### veCRV Boosts 

CRV is distributed continuously to users who stake certain liquidity provider tokens in Curve's gauge. Those CRV rewards can be increased when the user locks up their CRV in the [Locker](https://dao.curve.fi/locker). This locker gives the staker veCRV in return, which bears the right to vote in governance and the right to a portion of the protocol's fees. 

Locking CRV allows users to boost the CRV rewards they are receiving in eligible liquidity pools. The amount of the boost is determined by how much CRV was locked and how much liquidity they are receiving emissions on. 

Using the Backscratcher yVault, Yearn is locks up a significant amount of CRV indefinitely, and distributes the entitled boosts to various yVaults.  

### Backscratcher yVault

The Backscratcher yVault capitalizes on this feature in a way that's beneficial to both Curve and Yearn. Users deposit CRV into the vault which is locked infinitely, and in return they receive a token that represents a share of the pool. Revenue earned with that locked CRV is then redistributed within the pool and can be redeemed proportionally on a weekly basis. 

Additionally, 10% of all CRV earned by Yearn Finance is deposited into Backscratcher and locked infinitely. Because of this, people who want to stake CRV will always receive a higher share of the revenue with the Backscratcher yVault than staking directly through Curve. They also can earn emissions of tokens like SUSHI and PICKLE for providing liquidity. 

Users will never be able to withdraw their original CRV, but because of the incentives on yveCRV liquidity and the value that the token accrues from various sources of revenue, they will be able to swap it for another asset. 

In return, control over the locked CRV's boosts is given to Yearn, and utilized throughout various yVaults. 

## Auto-compounding yield 

Compounding yield requires transaction fees to be paid to the Ethereum blockchain. This can be expensive and cut into returns. 

Because yVaults batch your transaction with many other depositors, it is cumulatively lower cost and higher return to farm using the vaults. Currently, gas costs are covered by the Keep3r network, meaning that users are compounding returns for 0 cost. 

## Leverage 

Yearn utilizes the Iron Bank (C.R.E.A.M. Finance) to access credit that is used to enhance yVault yields in a safe manner. Only white-listed addresses are allowed to access credit in this manner, meaning that typically, individuals are not able to do this on their own. 

## Partnerships

The Backscratcher yVault is only possible due to synergistic relationships with protocols like Curve, SushiSwap and Pickle Finance. Our relationships across DeFi allow yVault depositors benefits that they cannot get elsewhere. 

Yearn actively collaborates on development with protocols like the ones mentioned in order to create new opportunities for yield and further DeFi as an industry.
