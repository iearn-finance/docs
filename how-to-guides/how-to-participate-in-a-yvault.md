## Cómo participar en una yVault

If you are here, it means you know what yVaults are and want to profit from them! There are X main steps to achieve your goal.

1. You need to have in your wallet at least one of the tokens required by any of the yVaults. ![](https://i.imgur.com/xWcBkLZ.png)
2. Chose a yVault and define how many tokens to deposit.
3. Approve the contract through the UI of your wallet.
4. Confirm the deposit transaction which will include the total amount of tokens you will deposit.
5. Check that transaction is successful.
6. Sit, relax, and let the ROI bring your passive income in.

### Let's breakdown the above steps.

#### 1. You need to have in your wallet at least one of the tokens required by any of the yVaults.

Let's take the curve.fi/y LP yVault as depositing into this highly performant vault is a multi step process and covers simpler cases.

**First: On-ramp!**

On-ramp means, going from Fiat into crypto. For this you have a few options:

* Most likely will need a OTC \(over the counter\) exchange, basically a centralized exchange. Coingeko offers a [good up-to-date list](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges) of posibilities.
* Certain wallets offer easy ETH purchase through partners. Torus offers purchase of ETH from Moonpay, Wyre, Ramp, etc. Brave browser's wallet and Metamask do offer similar posibilities through differen partners. Check your preferred wallet!

**Second: Obtaining yCRV LP tokens**

What need to do is to:

* Deposit stable coins \(DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD\) into a the [Y Curve liquidity pool](https://www.curve.fi/iearn/), which in exchange sends to your wallet a token that represents your deposit.
* You will receive in return an amount of yDAI/yUSDC/yUSDT/yTUSD tokens into your wallet \(you might need to add this custom token into your wallet\).

There is one extra step that you might have realized is missing. In the [FIRST](https://docs.yearn.finance/how-to-guides/how-to-participate-in-a-yvault#1-you-need-to-have-in-your-wallet-at-least-one-of-the-tokens-required-by-any-of-the-yvaults) step, you got ETH on your wallet, but now you need one of the above stable coins as input for the Liquidity Pool. You can get this stable coins in many different ways

* CEX \([Centralized Exchanges\)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges)\)
* DEXs \([Decentralized Exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized)\) and DEX aggregators such as [1inch.exchange ](https://1inch.exchange/)
* By providing collateral and borrowing a stable coin such as DAI through [MakerDAOs Oasis App](https://oasis.app/borrow) or [Instadapp](https://instadapp.io/) which aggregates features from several Defi apps and allows you to get DAI from a collateral such as ETH.

Let's recap, by now you should have gotten some ETH, exchanged it for some stable coins such as DAI and have deposited these stable coins into the Curve.fi Y Liquidity Pool. In your wallet you should have some tokens named "yDAI/yUSDC/yUSDT/yTUSD".

**THIRD: Deposit your LP tokens into yVault**

So finally, you need to go to [https://yearn.finance/vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults) and click in the yVault called "curve.fi/y LP" ![](https://i.imgur.com/tUl511S.png)

* You will need to connect your wallet for this to be shown.
* From the left side, you can chose which percentage of your yCRV tokens available in your wallet you want to deposit in the yVault

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/1vo6cRz.png)

* Once you've decided the quantity to deposit, click on deposit button. Your wallet will request you permission to "talk to the smart contract" and then it will request you to "confirm" the transaction.
* After succesful transaction you will see your yCRV \(LP tokens from the Y CRV liquidity Pool\) as deposited

## How To Participate in a yVault

This visual guide will walk you through every step in depositing funds in a [yVault](https://docs.yearn.finance/products/yvaults).

### Prerequisites

* You must have the yVault's underlying token. For DAI yVault, you must have DAI.
* You must use a supported wallet, either Metamask, Trustwallet, Trezor, or Torus.

### Walkthrough

#### 1. Go to [Vaults page](https://yearn.finance/vaults) and click on “Connect your wallet”

![connect metamask](https://i.imgur.com/ShWcOX6.jpg)

#### 2. Choose your favorite wallet

![choose wallet](https://i.imgur.com/TuabuVf.jpg)

#### 3. Enter your password and click “Unlock”

![metamask password](https://i.imgur.com/nep4a4D.jpg)

#### 4. Choose which Vault you want to deposit into, for example, the DAI Vault

![deposit DAI vault](https://i.imgur.com/IcmANu3.jpg)

#### 5. Enter the amount of DAI that you want to deposit

#### 6. Click “Deposit”

![deposit vault](https://i.imgur.com/RneAtGx.jpg)

Click on **25%, 50%, 75% or 100%** to deposit the corresponding proportion of your wallet into the Vault.

Or click “Deposit All” if you would like to **deposit 100%** of the chosen digital asset from your wallet into the Vault. :::info Please note before you make a deposit that there is a **0.5% withdrawal fee**. The longer you leave the deposit to earn returns in the Vault, the more likely your returns will exceed the withdrawal fee. :::

#### 7. Approve yearn.finance to spend your DAI token \(first time only\) and then click “Confirm” again to approve the deposit

![approve DAI vault](https://i.imgur.com/pPGoSiP.jpg)

You need to pay a **transaction fee in Ether \(ETH\)** to approve yearn.finance to spend your DAI.

Make sure there is **enough ETH in your wallet**.

#### 8. Receive your yToken \(in this case it would be yDAI\)

The yDAI you receive is your **share of the DAI Vault**. The amount of yDAI in your wallet will **remain constant** over time but the value of it will increase as the DAI Vault earns returns.

The amount of yDAI you receive will be less than 1 per DAI you deposited because yDAI is worth more than 1 DAI.

For example, at block number 10611372 yDAI was equal to 1.044 DAI. Therefore had you deposited 100 DAI, you would have received 95.78 yDAI \(100 / 1.044\).

#### 9. Track your earnings
