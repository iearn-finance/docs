# Gobernanza

Los holders de YFI gobiernan el ecosistema de Yearn y son elegibles para recibir una parte de las ganancias del protocolo. Por lo tanto, YFI representa un derecho a gobernar la plataforma y un reclamo sobre las ganancias. Los beneficios se obtienen de cada uno de los productos de Yearn.

Para poder reclamar parte de las ganancias del protocolo, los holders de YFI stakean sus tokens en el [Contrato de gobernanza](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0bc529c00C6401aEF6D220BE8C6Ea1667F6Ad93e?a=0xba37b002abafdd8e89a1995da52740bbc013d992). Profits are periodically sent to this contract from the Yearn [Vault del tesoro](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93a62da5a14c80f265dabc077fcee437b1a0efde#tokentxns) , which temporarily holds profits before distribution to stakeholders. Profits are sent to the Governance contract after the Treasury Vault has accrued a $500,000 reserve; this reserve is used to pay for various operational expenses, including developer compensation and community grants. The amount retained in the Treasury contract before profits are sent to the Governance contract are subject to change by YFI holders.

In order to vote on proposal changes to the ecosystem YFI holders must be staked in the governance contract. Stakeholders are _**u\***\_nable to withdraw_\*\_ their deposits for 72 hours after voting. They are also unable to claim their share of accrued, but undistributed profits, unless they have voted in a recent proposal. Profits are distributed as yCRV tokens.

The staking portal simplifies this process and can be found [here](https://ygov.finance/staking).
