This strategy lends YFI tokens on various lending platforms such as CREAM and AAVE to gain yield.

### v2 HEGIC yVault \([yvHEGIC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe11ba472f74869176652c35d30db89854b5ae84d)\) <a id="eb1c"></a>

[StrategyHegicETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41d638024c525c70a53b883608048e705e061f2c), [StrategyHegicWBTC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ce77bc655afaac83947c2e859819185966ca825), [StrategyLenderYieldOptimiser](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0cf55d57d241161e0ec68e72cbb175dbfe84173a)   
These three strategies work together to alternatively use HEGIC to buy ETH or WBTC lots on [HEGIC.co](https://www.hegic.co/). While the vault is building up the required 888,000 HEGIC needed to buy a lot, it lends it out on C.R.E.A.M to earn interest. The vault also keeps a buffer of HEGIC in reserve for withdrawals earning interest in CREAM.
