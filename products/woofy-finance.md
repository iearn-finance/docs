# Woofy Finance 

The WOOFY token allows YFI holders to be exposed to YFI in a fluffier package. 

At its core, WOOFY solves two problems: YFI not being dog themed, and the price of a single token being too high in USD terms.

**1 YFI = 1,000,000 WOOFY**. YFI and WOOFY can always be exchanged with one another at that fixed rate using either the [WOOFY contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd0660cd418a64a1d44e9214ad8e459324d8157f1#code), [Woofy Finance](https://woofy.finance/), or a third party interface.
