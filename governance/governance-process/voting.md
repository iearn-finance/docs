# Voting

## How do I vote?

- Holding or staking YFI in the following places will enable you to vote on Yearn's [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn) page:
	- Your wallet
	- YFI yVault V2 (equivalent to holding the yvYFI token)
	- Balancer YFI/WETH LP token
	- Uniswap YFI/WETH LP token
	- Sushiswap YFI/WETH LP token staked in MasterChef
	- MakerDAO YFI collateral
	- Unit Protocol YFI collateral
	- Bancor

## Where can I view the YIPs?

- You can view them on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn) or at [yips.yearn.finance](https://yips.yearn.finance/all-yip).

## Whatâ€™s the difference between voting for a poll on the forum and an off-chain vote?

- A poll just gauges the sentiment of what the community is feeling on the proposal while an off-chain vote (via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn)) will be binding and will take effect if it passes.
