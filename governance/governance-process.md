# Governance Process

The Yearn ecosystem is controlled by YFI token holders who submit and vote on off-chain proposals that govern the ecosystem. Proposals that generate a majority support (>50% of the vote) are implemented by a 9 member multi-signature wallet. Changes must be signed by 6 out of the 9 wallet signers in order to be implemented. The members of the multi-signature wallet were voted in by YFI holders and are subject to change from future governance votes. Please refer to our [FAQ](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/faq) for the list of the multisig signers and more information about the governance process.

# Discussion

Discussion regarding changes in the protocol happen on a variety of platforms such as:

 - [Governance Forum](https://gov.yearn.finance/)
 - [Discord](https://discord.yearn.finance)
 - [Telegram](https://t.me/yearnfinance)

It is recommended to get as much feedback as possible from the various channels of communication before introducing a formal proposal. The governance forum and Discord server have dedicated channels for specific topics.


# Implementation

Once a Snapshot vote has received over a majority support after 5 days of voting, changes will be implemented by Yearn's protocol or operations team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.

# Proposal

Proposals must be discussed for at least 3 days with a forum poll before they will be assigned a YIP number and move to Snapshot voting.

# Voting

## How do I vote?

- Holding or staking YFI in the following places will enable you to vote on Yearn's [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn) page:
	- Your wallet
	- YFI yVault V2 (equivalent to holding the yvYFI token)
	- Balancer YFI/WETH LP token
	- Uniswap YFI/WETH LP token
	- Sushiswap YFI/WETH LP token staked in MasterChef
	- MakerDAO YFI collateral
	- Unit Protocol YFI collateral
	- Bancor

## Where can I view the YIPs?

- You can view them on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn) or at [yips.yearn.finance](https://yips.yearn.finance/all-yip).

## Whatâ€™s the difference between voting for a poll on the forum and an off-chain vote?

- A poll just gauges the sentiment of what the community is feeling on the proposal while an off-chain vote (via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn)) will be binding and will take effect if it passes.
